 * Open dialog: if a URL was previously enterer in the "Open" or "Dub" fields an error message was shown when clicking the "Browse" button

 * Vobsub files with language/title in their filenames weren't auto-loaded

 * Fix a memory leak: the memory consumption would increase noticeably until the file was closed when the file had chapters and the chapter marks on seekbar were enabled
