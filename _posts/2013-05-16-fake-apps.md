.. title: Fake apps on Windows App Store
.. author: XhmikosR

.. abstract

It has come to our attention that there are several fake apps on the Windows App Store
that use our program's name.

.. body

We are not publishing MPC-HC on Windows App Store yet, so any programs you find there
should be considered **fake** and should be **reported** as they violate the license.

Don't forget, that our official builds, both the stable and the beta builds,
:doc:`are digitally signed </2013/02/25/binaries-are-signed>`.
